        Studies in Seattle have also shown that in many cases, these efforts come with tradeoffs disproportionately faced by marginalized communities. These sustainability efforts often lead to higher property values and a displacement of marginalized communities, specifically among people of color. Comparing Portland and Seattle shows how urban planning must consider equitable goals while also focusing on the environment. This focus on lessening urban sprawl can have unintended consequences like displacement and rising property values, which disproportionately disadvantage people of color and their communities. Urban sustainability requires a balance between social equity considerations, as well as grassroots activism and policy innovation.

        Chicago has had negative effects caused by their promotion of these initiatives. A key part of the process in Chicago is that a wide range of individuals including business leaders, community members, and lawmakers are all a part of the city development strategy. Though not perfect, this allows the strategy to be more equitable for all residents living within the Chicago city limits. Urban sustainability efforts are also connected to issues related to social equity. These efforts can displace low-income communities due to the high costs related to creating a sustainable city. Like the city of Seattle, this shows a central challenge in creating a more sustainable urban environment while being conscientious of the social consequences related to these efforts.
