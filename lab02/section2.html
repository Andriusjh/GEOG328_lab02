        To better understand urban sustainability within the city of Seattle we must take a look back at when it was put into practice in the Emerald City. Studies have explored how Seattle’s urban sustainability initiatives, grassroots activism, and structured planning can become a model for how the public can participate in environmental initiatives. Though the term “urban sustainability” had not officially been coined, practices that would be considered part of this movement were being implemented. During this period, activists worked tirelessly to protect sites like Pike Place Market for social justice and environmental protection reasons.

        Seattle’s urban growth and public transit investments furthered these environmental efforts that began in the 1990s. These practices help to preserve the natural beauty of Seattle and the surrounding area while also reducing the dependency on car transportation for Seattle residents, contributing to Seattle’s sustainability goals.
