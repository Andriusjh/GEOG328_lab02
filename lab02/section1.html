        Studies have also examined the role of urban sustainability initiatives in one of the biggest metropolitan cities in the United States, Chicago, Illinois. We will examine the Chicago Department of Environment’s Adding Green to Urban Design. These initiatives are designed to reduce the greenhouse effect, and urban heat island effect, as well as increase urban green spaces throughout all parts of the city. Specific examples of this include the Green Roof Program and the development of Millenium Park as a green space and outlet for those residents looking to escape the urban aspects of the city. These projects help reach environmental goals while also improving Chicago citizens’ quality of life.

        Differing from Seattle, Chicago’s approach creates a connected network of green spaces throughout the city for its residents. The use of green roofs throughout the city also helps to decrease the effects of urban heat islands and reduces energy consumption. Furthermore, the creation of the Chicago River boardwalk shows the city's constant commitment to expanding green spaces in the city. The boardwalk also provides economic opportunities for the cities through the countless bars and restaurants located on the riverside. These approaches help to magnify the city's urban resilience and its efforts toward promoting urban sustainability.
